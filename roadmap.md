Backlog
=======

# General
- [ ] Document more.
- [ ] Improve keyboard shortcuts (ctrl instead of alt, etc).
- [ ] Ensure proper key navigation at all times (sometimes ctrl+tab does not
      switch between tabs)
- [ ] testing the right-click menu on buttons
- [ ] Allow for a different location of the .noteorganiser folder (on SpiderOak
      instead of home directory, for instance)
- [ ] Fix the initial window size (#37)

# Library
- [ ] Draw vector icons, and use several sizes
- [ ] Have an application icon (#31 and #32)
- [ ] Display all tags in this zone

# Editing
- [ ] List of existing tags when entering a new field
- [ ] Keep cursor position on reload
- [ ] Have a basic search engine (#39)
- [ ] The NewEntry form should not accept "ESC" as a cancel option if there is
      text in the TextEdit block.

# Preview
- [ ] better overall css style (#40)
- [ ] Have a table of contents (#16)
- [ ] Button Refresh in Preview (not that external editor works) (#34)
- [ ] change the graphics of setFlat to match the disabled look, without the
    drawback of preventing scrolling.
- [ ] have a "global" page, storing all notebooks, filter added with the
    notebooks' name as a tag
- [ ] have several options for tag sorting:
  - [ ] importance (which also should use alphabetical for equally important tags)
  - [ ] alphabetical
  - [ ] cloud (*a la* Wiki)


Future work
===========

- [ ] have a preview of the entry while typing it
- [ ] rethink the user experience: library panel? browsing?
- [ ] colored icons and tags, with colors chosen by the user
- [ ] support well multi-screen
- [ ] use only one webpage, and stop displaying members instead of generating all
      these webpages! Using an underlying sort of table system, which you could
      turn on/off (javascript?)

# Library
- [ ] special graphic for shelves, maybe wood?
