Note Organiser for scientists
=============================

Objective
---------

Provide scientists, IT professionals but also normal people, with a solid
note-taking GUI.

Status
------

Early development, should reach 0.1 in September. See the roadmap for detailed
plans (browse the raw format, as Github does not apply the Github flavored
syntax to files), and feel free to suggest any thing I missed in the issues.

Minimal Features (for 0.1)
--------------------------

- Markdown syntax for a clear source file, readable without the software.
- Tag system for entries for classification
- Html previewing of the note file, with tag and date sorting

License
-------

The code is published under the MIT license, please see LICENSE.txt for the
complete notice.
